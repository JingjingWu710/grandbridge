## GrandBridge

This project aims to develop a website application that engages the community in support roles, alleviates food insecurity among left-behind families, and enhances the mental health of caregivers of left-behind children.

Left-behind children comprise a significant portion of the population in certain countries. The aging caregivers of left behind children are facing many unique challenges, such as poverty, depression, and stress, and the children could suffer from nutrition deficiencies. So far, the number of childcare management platforms has increased rapidly. However, there are rare platforms that focus on the needs of caregivers of left-behind children, which are often vulnerable and invisible, and recognize the importance of community. 
Given the unique circumstances of this group, this project provides caregivers withÂ access to financial, food, psychological, and community support. It is implemented by Flask, which is suitable for quickly developing a website application with testable functionality, and integrates current advanced development tools to build an effective and human-centered system.
